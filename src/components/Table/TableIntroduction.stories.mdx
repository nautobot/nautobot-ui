# Table Introduction

There are two approaches to building tables with `nautobot-ui`:

  1. [**With helpers (Table Renderer)**](/story/components-table--table-renderer),
  using `TableRenderer` component and `useTableRenderer` hook.
  > **Recommended for standard use cases**. To be used when there is a standard
  > table to create. Existing helpers  already implement common logic, helping
  > to reduce boilerplate code. At the same time they are generic and extensible
  > enough to enable handling standard use cases.

  > _This approach forces using `@tanstack/react-table` library implemented in
  > `useTableRenderer` hook._


  2. [**From scratch (Basic)**](/story/components-table--basic), using basic
  components as building blocks.
  > **Recommended for very simple or custom use cases**. Useful when a
  > non-standard table use case is required. Allows setting virtually anything
  > in table component, because it requires using each table element separately.
  > Should be chosen when there is a custom table UI or behavior to build.

  > _This approach doesn't force using `@tanstack/react-table` library._
